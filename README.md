The code in the "code.ipynb" file classifies seven types of basalt from different tectonic environments (IPB, IAB, OIB, MORB, BABB, OFB, CFB) using SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms. 
The file "data_train.xlsx" contains the training data, and "data_test.xlsx" contains the testing data.

It mainly includes the following contents: 
1. Training with 22 and 35 elements as features;
2. Calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each algorithm;
3. Calculating and Visualizing the confusion matrix;
4. Using SHAP to calculate the importance of each element;
5. Visualizing the results of SHAP.
